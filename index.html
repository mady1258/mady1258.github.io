<p>Its time to get productive.</p>
<p>Most organizations don't choose to replace their ERP system for the sake of replacement. Instead, ERP systems are replaced by necessity and a culmination of events and circumstances that usually require a system to be replaced. Replacing an ERP is a difficult and time‐consuming process in and of itself, but you would be remiss to not consider how you can leverage emerging technologies such as ML/AI in this process to get more value out of your investment. Whether you are considering a new ERP, or you have been running Dynamics 365 for some time, we help you to achieve more with your solution.[ Rachel Profitt ‘Senior Program Manager, Microsoft’]

Historical Data migration
Absolutely, historical data is a valuable asset for any organization, and being able to bring that data into a new ERP system using Microsoft Azure and Power BI can provide valuable insights and help predict future trends and patterns.
By leveraging the power of Microsoft Azure and Power BI, we can help our customers to bring their historical data from legacy systems into their new ERP implementation. This process involves extracting data from the legacy system, transforming the data to the format required by the new ERP system, and loading the data into the new system.
Once the historical data has been migrated into the new ERP system, we can use Power BI to develop customized dashboards and reports that allow users to analyze the data and gain insights into historical trends and patterns. These insights can be used to make informed business decisions and predict future trends.
Power BI provides a range of tools and features that allow users to create interactive visualizations and reports based on historical data. These reports can be customized to meet the specific needs and goals of our customers, and can include key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics that align with their business objectives.
Overall, our approach to bringing historical data into a new ERP system using Microsoft Azure and Power BI is designed to help our customers make the most of their data. By leveraging the latest technology and our expertise in data migration and analytics, we can help our customers gain valuable insights into historical trends and patterns and use that information to predict future outcomes and make informed business decisions.
Bypassing the challenges in historical data migration
Organizations face several challenges when migrating historical data from legacy systems to a new ERP system. Some of the common challenges include:
1.	Data Quality: Data quality is a critical factor in any data migration project. Historical data from legacy systems may contain errors, duplications, or inconsistencies that can impact the accuracy and reliability of the data in the new system. Cleaning and validating data can be a time-consuming and complex process.
2.	Data Complexity: Historical data from legacy systems can be complex and difficult to understand. It may be stored in different formats, structures, or systems, making it difficult to extract, transform, and load into the new ERP system.
3.	Data Volume: Historical data can be voluminous, and migrating large amounts of data can be a daunting task. This can impact the speed and efficiency of the migration process.
4.	Data Security: Historical data may contain sensitive information, such as financial or personal data. Ensuring the security and privacy of this data during the migration process is critical.
5.	Integration with Existing Systems: Migrating historical data into a new ERP system may require integration with existing systems and processes, such as data warehouses, business intelligence tools, or reporting systems. Ensuring compatibility and seamless integration can be a challenge.
6.	User Adoption: Migrating historical data into a new ERP system may require changes to business processes, user interfaces, or workflows. Ensuring user adoption and buy-in to the new system can be a challenge.
In conclusion, organizations face several challenges when migrating historical data from legacy systems to a new ERP system. These challenges can impact the accuracy, reliability, and security of the data, as well as the speed and efficiency of the migration process. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes data cleaning and validation, understanding data complexity, managing data volume, ensuring data security, integrating with existing systems, and ensuring user adoption.
